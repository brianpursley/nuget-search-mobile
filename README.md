NuGet Search
============

NuGet Search is an Android application demonstrating the use of [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) and C# to create and publish an Android application that makes use of asynchronous processing and web service calls.

The goal of this application is to provide package search functionality similar to that of the [NuGet Gallery](http://www.nuget.org/) website while staying within the boundaries of the free [Xamarin Starter Edition](https://store.xamarin.com/):

> Xamarin Starter allows developers to build and publish simple apps, which contain no more than 64k of compiled user code (IL), and which do not call out to native third party libraries (i.e., developers may not P/Invoke into C/C++/Objective-C/Java.
